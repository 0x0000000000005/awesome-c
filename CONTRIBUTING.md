# Contribution Guide #

First of all, thank for your contribution! I can't manage this whole thing
alone, and I welcome pull requests. To make sure that we're all on the same
page, here are some guidelines to follow for submitting pull requests for this
list.

## What would be great ##

Obviously, it's your choice what you want to contribute - or not
contribute. However, if you're looking for something that would help awesome-c,
check the current issues, especially those tagged with 'help wanted'. Pull
requests addressing these are particularly great!

## How to contribute ##

Now for the mechanics of the process, and some do's and don't's.

### Ensure that everything you link to is free (as in freedom) ###

This is highly important - this list *only* contains freedom-respecting things!
If you are sending a pull request linking to code, ensure it is licensed under a
freedom-respecting license. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Anything on the [OSI license list][1]
- Creative Commons Zero

If you're not sure, better to ask first. If it's not on the list above
especially.

### Indicate the license for anything you add clearly ###

Ensure that you label licenses correctly. ``awesome-c`` now uses [SPDX][2]
license labels, so please use those. If the license is weird or not on the list,
label it as clearly as possible. Also check if the license is in use
already - if it is, don't create another link to it.

Sometimes, libraries or frameworks will contain documentation or code under
different licenses to the library itself (such as tests or examples). There is
no need to indicate their licenses in that case. However, if the program itself
is what is being put on the list, *obviously* its license matters.

## Maintain alphabetical order within sections ##

Pretty self-explanatory, really. Numbers are considered to be higher-ordered
than anything else, and otherwise, lex order.

## Give a clear commit message ##

The commit message should state clearly *what* you did (adding, removing,
clarifying, etc.), with *what* (usually by giving the name of the entry), in the
present continuous tense (i.e. 'adding' not 'added').
