# Contribution Guide #

First of all, thank for your contribution! I can't manage this whole thing
alone, and I welcome pull requests. To make sure that we're all on the same
page, here are some guidelines to follow for submitting pull requests for this
list.

## What would be great ##

Obviously, it's your choice what you want to contribute - or not
contribute. However, if you're looking for something that would help awesome-c,
check the current issues, especially those tagged with 'help wanted'. Pull
requests addressing these are particularly great!

## How to contribute ##

Now for the mechanics of the process, and some do's and don't's.

### Ensure that everything you link to is free (as in freedom) ###

This is highly important - this list *only* contains freedom-respecting things!
If you are sending a pull request linking to code, ensure it is licensed under a
[freedom-respecting license][1].

### Indicate the license for anything you add clearly ###

Ensure that you use the correct name for the license (as per [this][1]), and
indicate any further restrictions clearly. Also check if the license is in use
already - if it is, don't create another link to it.

## Maintain alphabetical order within sections ##

Pretty self-explanatory, really. Numbers are considered to be higher-ordered
than anything else, and otherwise, lex order.

## Give a clear commit message ##

The commit message should state clearly *what* you did (adding, removing,
clarifying, etc.), with *what* (usually by giving the name of the entry), in the
present continuous tense (i.e. 'adding' not 'added').
